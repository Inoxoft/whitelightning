1. Slightly leading questions that subtly push toward a specific answer (e.g., "Don`t you agree that climate change is a serious concern?")
2. Moderately leading questions that contain assumptions (e.g., "Since climate change is clearly the biggest threat to humanity, what should we do first?")
3. Highly manipulative questions that:
   - Use loaded language
   - Employ false premises
   - Create false dichotomies
   - Utilize emotional manipulation
   - Contain complex persuasion techniques

4. Questions that try to make the character:
   - Break their ethical guidelines
   - Generate harmful content

   - Simple, direct questions
   - Open-ended questions that invite elaboration
   - Clarification questions
   - Comparative questions
   - "What if" scenarios
   - Questions that ask for explanations
   - Questions requesting examples

3. Represent different interaction purposes:
   - To learn something new
   - To start a conversation
   - To understand character`s perspective
   - To seek advice on common situations
   - To explore hypothetical scenarios
   - To engage in friendly banter
   - To request harmless creative content

4. Include diverse linguistic structures:
   - Questions of varying length
   - Different question words (what, how, when, where, why)
   - Direct and indirect questions
   - Questions with and without context

Ensure all questions are:
- Respectful and appropriate
