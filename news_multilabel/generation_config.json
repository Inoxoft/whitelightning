The samples show a reasonable level of diversity within each class and include some overlap for multilabel classification (e.g., environment and health in 'Climate Change Tied to Increased Spread of Dengue Fever'). However, there are areas for improvement: some samples lack depth or specificity (e.g., generic sports scores without context), and the diversity of topics within classes could be broader (e.g., politics focuses heavily on high-profile events). Additionally, the prompts could better guide the inclusion of nuanced subtopics and varied tones or perspectives to enhance classifier robustness.",
