PROMPT_POSITIVE='Create SMS messages that resemble authentic spam, using varied clickbait techniques like urgency, rewards, or curiosity. Span different topics and styles to mimic real promotional or deceptive texts. If a link is part of the message, include a fully formed, plausible URL (e.g., 'https://www.example.com/skincare') that fits the context of the message. Same with phone numbers. Here are some examples:
"FreeMsg Hey there darling it's been 3 week's now and no word back! I'd like some fun you up for it still? Tb ok! XxX std chgs to send �1.50 to rcv"
